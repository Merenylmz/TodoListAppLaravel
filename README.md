# TodoListApp Laravel
This project is a Laravel version of the project I made in plain javascript in my github account, and it is a Server side project.

# to make it work
Open a terminal and type "php artisan migrate" and type "php artisan serve" to run the project, then go to the url "localhost:8000/todos"
